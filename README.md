ELEVATE LABS TASK 2
This project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying an application.

The pipeline is integrated with GitHub, so every time new code is pushed to the repository, Jenkins automatically triggers the pipeline. The pipeline consists of multiple stages like build, test, and deploy, ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery of the application.
Jenkins installed and configured (Locally / Cloud Instance)

1.GitHub integrated with Jenkins using Webhooks
2.Automated pipeline defined using Jenkinsfile
3.Pipeline stages
